The distinction between being watched and being known is everything, and we have built an entire economy around the former while systematically eroding the latter.</p><h2>What Actually Helps</h2><p>The research on effective interventions is clear and consistently ignored. It is not apps. What works is physical proximity combined with repeated, low-stakes interaction over time. The reason military veterans report such intense camaraderie is not the shared trauma — it is the months of physical co-presence, shared meals, and enforced cooperation.</p><p>We have built an economy that optimizes for individual productivity, geographic mobility, and frictionless digital consumption.

First, it underestimated how much of what cities provide is physically irreplaceable: the density of specialized workers, the serendipity of professional proximity, the cultural infrastructure that only reaches critical mass above a certain population threshold.</p><p>Second, it overestimated the attractiveness of the alternative.

School districts face insurance premium increases and legal exposure that makes the program economically unsustainable.</p><h2>The Deeper Cultural Shift</h2><p>Generation Z makes different risk calculations than previous generations.

More often, it looks like the gradual devaluation of coastal real estate in Norfolk and Miami, the emptying of small agricultural towns in the Central Valley as aquifer depletion makes farming unviable, and the population decline of rural counties where hotter conditions have reduced the economic carrying capacity of the land.</p><h2>Where People Are Going</h2><p>Research suggests US climate migration is flowing toward mid-elevation mountain cities, the Upper Midwest Great Lakes region, and secondary Northeastern cities — places with reliable water and moderate summers.
